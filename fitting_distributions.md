## Fitting distributions with R

I found [this blog post](http://www.magesblog.com/2011/12/fitting-distributions-with-r.html) on fitting dist 
with R very useful. Particulary the graph. Plus the blog references two useful articles :

+ [Fitting distributions with R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Ricci-distributions-en.pdf), by vito Ricci.
+ [Clicable diagram of distribution relationships](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/distribution_chart/), by Jhon Cook.
