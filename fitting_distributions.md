## Fitting distributions with R

I found [this blog post](http://www.magesblog.com/2011/12/fitting-distributions-with-r.html) on fitting dist 
with R very useful. Particulary the graph. Plus the blog references two useful articles :

+ [Fitting distributions with R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Ricci-distributions-en.pdf), by vito Ricci.
+ [Clicable diagram of distribution relationships](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/distribution_chart/), by Jhon Cook.

[This post on stackoverflow](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/132652/how-to-determine-which-distribution-fits-my-data-best) Introduced me to the **fitdistrplus** package, which I found quite useful for quickly testing which dist fits my data.
