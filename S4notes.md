# S4 Notes 

Following are the notes I have collected while learning S4 implementation for package development.

1. [A practical tutorial on S4
programming](https://www.bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2013/CSAMA2013/friday/afternoon/S4-tutorial.pdf) 
from CSAMA2013 : A good start.

2. Hadley Wickham's [The S4 object system](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/S4.html) from advance R. Note: Hadley's packages don't
use S4 and I think therefore the tutorial is not up-to-date. Eg: it still uses the deprecated `representation` function 
while defining a **Class**.

3. Robert Gentelman's tutorial : [S4 Classes in 15 pages](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/S-Workshop/Gentleman/S4Objects.pdf). 
This tutorial is also old (from 2003) and therefore uses deprecated functions.

4. Bioconductor guide to [implementing S4 class](https://www.bioconductor.org/developers/package-guidelines/#classes). It's
not a tutorial, just a small set of recommendations for S4 implementation.
